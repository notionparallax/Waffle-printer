# Waffle-printer
A quick and dirty way of printing waffle cards.

We* needed a way to get our cards out of waffle.io 

We really like [git2pdf](https://github.com/pocketworks/git2pdf) by [Pocketworks](http://www.pocketworks.co.uk/) but because it pulls from Github the story points don't come through.

We got around this in the quickest dirtyest way we could. We might make it better in future if we need to, but for today this does the job.

## How

Clone this repo.

From inside this folder run `ruby waffle-cards-printer.rb`

Open `cards.html` and print it.

#so

This is super clunky. If you have any better ideas then we're all ears!
